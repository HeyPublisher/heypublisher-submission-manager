## Changelog

### 2.3.0
+ Released: 2017-05-30
+ [[#53](https://github.com/aguywithanidea/heypublisher-submission-manager/issues/53)] : Released experimental feature that prompts writers to subscribe to your mailing list when submitting work.  This feature requires you already have a MailChimp account.  (You alreay have a MailChimp account, don't you??)


### 2.2.0
+ Released: 2017-04-02
+ [[#37](https://github.com/aguywithanidea/heypublisher-submission-manager/issues/37)] : Changed "Year Established" to a dropdown list.  For publications published in the year "g" we apologize.
+ [[#54](https://github.com/aguywithanidea/heypublisher-submission-manager/issues/54)] : Fixed weird formatting that was occurring on the Options page in WP 4.7.3.
+ [[#40](https://github.com/aguywithanidea/heypublisher-submission-manager/issues/40)] : Validated that plugin works in WP 4.7.3.
+ [[#41](https://github.com/aguywithanidea/heypublisher-submission-manager/issues/41)] : Updated account creation to use the "Username" of the author in HeyPublisher as the Username in WP, when possible.  Email addresses are no longer used as usernames.
+ [[#50](https://github.com/aguywithanidea/heypublisher-submission-manager/issues/50)] : Removed the Dashboard widget that was not being used by anyone, ever.

### 2.1.0
+ Released : 2017-03-23
+ You now can use [Username] and [UserID] keyword substitutions in email templates (thanks for the suggestion Andy!)
+ Even though Andy didn't ask for it, we also added the ability for publishers to include their [ISSN](http://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/the-issn-international-register/) in their HeyPublisher listing.

### 2.0.1
+ Released : 2017-02-20
+ Fixed style sheet not properly styling custom email template edit forms.  It was ugly - we know that now.

### 2.0.0
+ Finally got around to that redesign everyone has been begging us for :)
+ The Options page is now a single form, which should prevent those pesky javascript errors that prevented some folks from fully configuring the plugin because they couldn't bring up the other tabs.
+ The uninstall plugin link is now on the first screen, beneath the Plugin Statistics - not that you'd ever want to use this, but just in case.
+ The plugin was basically overhauled, from the ground up.  It renders faster.  The code is better organized.  Building upon this version will allow us to turn around new features faster.

### 1.5.1
+ Writers will now be prompted to provide their name, bio and website URL when submitting works to your publication.
+ Better yet - that information is fully imported into WordPress when you accept their submission for publication.

### 1.5.0
+ You now have the ability to request a revision of an already accepted submission - which you will probably want at some time.
+ You now have the ability to reimport previously accepted submissions.  This is cool.  Upgrade just for this functionality.
