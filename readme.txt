HeyPublisher gives you a better way of managing submissions directly within WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you as to accept submissions from writers.  You define categories and other filters to ensure you only receive the submissions that meet your publication's needs.  And there is no need to create user accounts for writers just so they can submit content to your publication.
